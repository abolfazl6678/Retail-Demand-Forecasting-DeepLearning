# Retail-Inventory-Demand-Forecasting-DeepLearning
This project applies deep learning to a critical supply chain problem: predicting daily product demand in retail stores. Using the Kaggle Retail Inventory Forecasting dataset, I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression model to forecast the number of units sold for each product-store-day combination.
