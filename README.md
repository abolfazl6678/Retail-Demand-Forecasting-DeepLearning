# Retail-Demand-Forecasting-DeepLearning
This project applies deep learning - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - to build a model for **prediction of daily product demand in retail stores**.

---

## Project Overview
Accurate  product demand forcast is a critical challenge in retail supply chains due to its direct effect on lost sales if it is lower and excess cost due to overstocking if it is higher. In this project, I used  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), one of the main methods in Deep Learning, to predict daily product demandin retail stores.
**Business Insights:** Forecasting results provide actionable insights to minimize stock-outs, reduce excess inventory, and optimize replenishment planning.

## Project Objectives and assumptions

- Build a model to predict daily demand for each product 
- The model is built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - Deep Learning
- The model is trained by a dataset containing past sales, inventory levels, and product/store details given for each product in a given day
- **Modeling Assumption1:** Each day is treated as independent, allowing the task to be framed as standard supervised learning.
- **Modeling Assumption2:** Daily features (past sales, inventory, product/store attributes) are assumed to capture relevant patterns, removing the need for explicit time-series modeling.
- **Problem Formulation:** The model is formulated as a supervised regression problem, where daily product/store features are used to predict the expert demand forecast.
- **Frameworks:** The model is implemented using two major deep learning Python libraries: **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
- **GPU:** The model is designed to automatically use GPU (if available) for faster training, evaluation, and prediction.

## PyTorch vs TensorFlow – My Observations
- **Both frameworks** have shown strong results in prediction of demand forcast.
- **PyTorch:** More intuitive training loop, easier debugging.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** More concise, production-ready, easier deployment with TensorFlow Serving.
