This project applies deep learning to a critical supply chain problem: predicting daily product demand in retail stores. Using the Kaggle Retail Inventory Forecasting dataset, I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression model to forecast the number of units sold for each product-store.

## Project Overview
Accurate  product demand (Units_Sold) is a critical challenge in retail supply chains due to its direct effect on lost sales if it is lower and excess cost due to overstocking if it is higher. In this project, I used  **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, one of the main methods in deep learning, to **predict daily product demand (Units_Sold)** based on store, product, and inventory data.
The dataset comes from [Kaggle – Retail Store Inventory Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anirudhchauhan/retail-store-inventory-forecasting-dataset).

## Project Objectives

- Build a model to predict the number of units sold for each product
- The model is built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and trained by past sales, inventory levels, and product/store details given for each product in each store on a given day
- The model is formulated as a **supervised regression problem**.
- The performance of the model is compared to trditional machine learning models (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGboost, Random Forst)

   - Tune hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, hidden units)  

3. **Evaluation**
   - Compare ANN vs baseline (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - Plot Actual vs Predicted demand  

4. **Insights**
   - Identify demand patterns by product & store  
   - Show potential for **reducing stock-outs** and **minimizing holding costs**
